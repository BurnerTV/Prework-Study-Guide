# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description 

This web page was designed to help me and other students with the initial process and foundations of learning to code. It has information on HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript. This project was to practice and learn the basic foundations of coding in preparation for coding bootcamp. The Prework Study Guide was made for referencing purposes as I further my knowledge and understanding of how to code. It gives a foundation of my intial knowledge of coding and what I learned before class even started! I learned about HTML being the foundation of the house that is the code, CSS being the decorations and flashy stuff, Javascript being the functionality of the code and Git being used in order to pull and merge the code into the repo.
